# Simple Zustand Demo

A simple demonstration of using **Zustand** for state management in a React application. This project shows how to create and use Zustand stores to manage global state in a scalable and minimal way.

## Introduction

This demo project is built to illustrate how you can integrate Zustand with React to manage application state efficiently. It covers basic usage patterns like creating stores, selecting and updating state, and organizing store logic.

## Features

- Minimal boilerplate state management  
- Simple create and use store with hooks  
- State updates and selectors for React components  
- Example actions (e.g., increment, toggle, set value)  
- Clear demo structure for learning purposes  

## Why Zustand

Zustand is a lightweight, unopinionated state-management library that provides an intuitive API using React hooks. Compared to things like Redux or Context API, Zustand offers:
- Less boilerplate  
- No need for Provider components — the store is directly usable anywhere  
- Efficient re-rendering by selecting slices of state  
- Support for async actions and derived state :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)  
- npm or yarn

## Tech Stack

- React — UI library
- Vite — Build tool for development
- Zustand — State management
